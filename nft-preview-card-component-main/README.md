## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### Continued development

Using perhaps grid system instead of Flexbox. Refactor using SASS. Learning CSS tricks such as transitions over elements using pseudo-elements.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - I used this page to look up basic styling options and as a reference on how to get going quickly with any particular CSS styling properties that I was unfamiliar with.
